        <h3>The dog eagerly proceeds down the dark hallway. You aren't so sure about this...</h3>
        <p>You walk down the hallway anyway. After all you have a companion to keep you safe...right?</p>
        <p>You and the dog come upon a lonely glass of water standing on the floor, at the end of the hallway. In front of you is a dead end.</p>
        <div class="water-img"><img src="water-glass.jpeg"></div>
        <p>You realize how parched you are, but notice the dog is also very thirsty.</p>
        <p>You have a choice to make. You can either give the dog the water, or you can take the water for yourself.</p>
        <p>What is your next course of action?</p>
